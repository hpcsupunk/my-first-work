            <p><center>About SriLankan Airlines
                Launched in 1979, Sri Lankaâ€™s National Carrier 
                is an award winning airline with a solid reputation 
                for service, comfort, safety, reliability, and punctuality.

                SriLankan Airlines (formerly known as Air Lanka) 
                is the flag carrier of Sri Lanka and a member 
                airline of the Oneworld airline alliance. It is currently 
                the largest airline in Sri Lanka by number
                of aircraft and destinations and was launched in 1979 as
                Air Lanka following the termination of operations of the original 
                Sri Lankan flag carrier Air Ceylon. Following 
                its partial acquisition in
                1998 by Emirates, it was re-branded and the 
                current livery was introduced.
                In 2008, the government of Sri Lanka acquired
                 all the shares of the airline
                from Emirates.[5] After ending the Emirates
                 partnership, it retained 
                its re-branded name and logo.[6] SriLankan 
                Airlines operates over 560 
                flights per week across Asia.
